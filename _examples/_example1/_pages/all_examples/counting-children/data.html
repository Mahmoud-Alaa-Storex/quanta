<h1>Counting children of a Node</h1>

You can count how many children a node has by using the &lsqb;COUNT&rsqb; tag.
<br /><br />
In example, by running this command on home:
&lsqb;COUNT:home&rsqb;
<br /><br />
We get this result: <b>[COUNT:home]</b>
<br /><br />
Reflecting the number of elements in the whole [LINK|title=TREE:lists-and-trees] of the [LINK|title=home:home] node:
<br /><br />
[TREE|nolinks|box=100xauto|border=1|padding=20|centered:home]
<br /><br />
It's also possible to setup mindepth or maxdepth parameters, to choose at which level to start counting.
<br /><br />
&lsqb;COUNT|maxdepth=1:home&rsqb; will return <b>[COUNT|maxdepth=1:home]</b>
<br /><br />
and
<br /><br />
&lsqb;COUNT|mindepth=2:home&rsqb; will return <b>[COUNT|mindepth=2:home]</b>
