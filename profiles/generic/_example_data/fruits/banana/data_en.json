These plants belong to the genus Musa. They are native to the tropical region of Southeast Asia. There are about 110 different species of banana.<\/p><p>It is thought that bananas were grown for food for the first time in Papua New Guinea.[1] Today, they are cultivated in tropical regions around the world.[2]<\/p><p>Most banana plants are grown for their herbs, but some are grown as ornamental plants, or for their fibres.[3] In parts of Africa, beer has been made by fermenting the juice of certain cultivars, known as beer bananas.[3] The ash of banana can be used to make soap.[3] In Asia, bananas are often planted to provide shade to plants that like shade, for example coffee, cocoa, nutmeg or black pepper.[3] Because of this, banana plants can often be found in plantations of other crops.<\/p><p>Some kinds, or cultivars, of banana have a firmer, starchier fruit. These kinds are called plantains. Plantains are mostly used for cooking or fibre.
